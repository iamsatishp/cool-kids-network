Cool Kids Network: User Management System
Problem to Be Solved
The Cool Kids Network is a website where users can register, create a character, and interact with other users based on their roles. The challenge was to implement a user management system that allows:

User Registration: Anonymous users can sign up and automatically generate a character.

Role-Based Access: Users with special roles ("Cooler Kid" and "Coolest Kid") can view other users' data with varying levels of access.

Role Management: Admins can change user roles through a secure API endpoint.

The goal was to create a proof of concept that demonstrates these features while ensuring security, scalability, and ease of use.
